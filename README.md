# Rogue Certificate Authority (RCA) - Proof of Concept

1. Create a `CA` to emulate a real-life `CA` that would be hard-coded on a brand new `OS`
2. Create a `website` or `web service`
3. Administer an `SSL Certificate` to the `website` or `web service` based on that "real-life `CA`" described above
4. Create a way to authenticate `SSL Certificate`s
5. Create a Rogue Certificate Authority (`RCA`)
6. Administer a `Rogue SSL Certificate` (`RSC`) for a `rogue website` or `rogue web service`
7. Validate the `RSC`
